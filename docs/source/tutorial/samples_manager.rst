Importing battery samples
#########################

.. note::

   If you have already imported your samples into the app, you may proceed with protocol creation in the next step.

A cycling experiment requires first and foremost a battery sample to cycle. This page will guide you through uploading battery sample specifications onto the app using Aurora's sample importer feature.

First, navigate to the *Samples* section of the *Inventory*.

.. figure:: /_static/images/samples_inventory.png

Expand **Import samples from robot output** to open the importer.

.. _samples_spec_file:

Click *Select/Change* to choose a battery sample specifications file (``.csv`` format). This file may contain more than one sample (typically 36). Once a file is selected, form controls will become active allowing you to enter metadata for the sample batch.

.. tip::

   To download a battery sample specifications template, click `here <../_static/examples/example.specs.csv>`_.

When ready, click *Import Samples* to uploaded the samples. The samples will appear in the selection box below.

.. important::

   Samples are not yet saved to the local cache. To do so, click the *save* button (‚úÖ) at the bottom left corner of the *Samples* tab. Alternatively, to reset changes, click on the *refresh* button (üîÑÔ∏è).

Once the samples are saved, they are immediately available for selection in the *Experiment* tab. More on this in a later section.

Additional Operations
*********************

This section covers the remaining operations that may be taken on available samples in the inventory. After each operation, remember to either save or reset your changes.

Grouping
========

You can create custom sample groups in Aurora. These may be used to quickly narrow down sample selections when building an experiment. To do so, expand **Groups**, click the *plus* button (‚ûï) to open the new group name dialog box, enter a name for the new group, and click the adjacent *save* button (‚úÖ). The new group will appear in the group dropdown menu. You may select it or any other available group.

Once a group is selected, you can select one or more samples from the samples selector above to add to the group. As you do so, a table will appear at the bottom of the section with additional information on all selected samples. Once selected, click the *add samples* button (üîΩ) to add the selected samples to the group. To remove samples from the group, select them selection box under **Groups** and click the *remove samples* button (üîº).

At any point, you may save the group by clicking the *save group* button (‚úÖ), or reset your changes by clicking the *reset group* button (üîÅ). You may also discard a group by clicking the *delete group* button (üóëÔ∏è).

Filtering
=========

Various sample metadata may be used as filtering arguments to narrow down the sample selection options, including the custom sample groups mentioned in the previous section. Filter options are auto-populated from sample metadata. To narrow down the samples, expand **Filters** and select a combination of one or more values. Values will adjust reactively based on your selection. You may reset the filters at any time by clicking the *reset filters* button (üîÅ).

.. figure:: /_static/images/samples_filtering.png

.. tip::

   The number ``[##]`` next to each filter value represents the current number of available samples if the filter is selected.

Deleting
========

Available samples may be deleted by selecting them in the available samples panel and clicking the *delete samples* button below (üóëÔ∏è). Once deleted (and changes are saved), these samples will no longer be available for selection when preparing experiments.

.. note::

   Be aware that deleting samples does not remove them from AiiDA if previously used in an experiment, as this will destroy experiment provenance - the relational mapping between the various components of an experiment that ensure reproducibility.

Sub-batching
============

Lastly, it is often desired to divide a batch of samples into sub-batches. Controls for this task are available at the bottom right corner of the *Samples* tab. Select the desired samples, enter a sub-batch identifier in the textbox, and click the adjacent *approve* button (‚úÖ). The samples selection panel will reflect your changes.
